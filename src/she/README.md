# SHE - Simplified Hardware Entry-point

`she` is an abstraction layer to access in different way to the
hardware/operating system. We have our own implementation to create
windows and handle mouse/keyboard input. The graphics are rendered
using the [Skia](https://skia.org/) library.

* Minimum Windows platform: Windows Vista
